To Install:
	//The version of PDFTK in Debian Stable has a bug that prevents this from working,
	//and therefore it must be manually installed into /opt as /opt/pdftk-newer

	//You must also have gcj-dev and g++ installed
	$ sudo apt-get install gcj-dev g++
	$ wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/pdftk/pdftk_2.02.orig.tar.gz
	$ tar -zxvf pdftk_2.02.orig.tar.gz
	$ cd pdftk-2.02-dist
	$ cd pdftk
	//Because the Debian Makefile seems not to work,
	$ make -f Makefile.Slackware-13.1
	$ cp pdftk /opt/pdftk-newer
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

     copy the usr/lib/pdfcomp directory in the source package into your /usr/lib directory.
